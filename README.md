# ZuckApp
complete foss recreation/client of whatsapp

# Why
A lot of people that actually care about their privacy (including me)
are forced to use whatsapp because
of a ceratin group chat or just because of the network effect

And the fact that whatsapp is owned by the zuck personnaly doesnt really satisfy me
yes it has E2EE but im not really sure if zuck is the most trustworthy person
to for providing E2EE or installing his app

the fact that the only whatsapp alternative client that exists is whatsapp web to go
which just SUCKS tbh is pretty suprising for me...

# How will you find the apis that whatsapp uses
I will reverse engineer the app

# Will you ever release whatsapp's source?

NO 

Why? Because i really REALLY dont want a cease and desist letter 
to arrive to my mail

if you need it reverse it yourself

# What if the ZUCK bans you

I Dont Care 
i will continue on another git hosting under another name

if you will need it you will find it

# What is the current progress?
